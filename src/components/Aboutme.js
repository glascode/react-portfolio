      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Anthony Garcia, i'm a 26 year old software engineer operating out of Las Vegas, Nevada.
        <br></br>
        Though it feels like forever ago, i'm only about 2 years into my developer journey.
        <br></br>
        I've made drastic improvments compared to when I first began, especially within the last three months.
        <br></br>
        I'm continually excited to learn new skills and improve as a developer, and that isn't changing any time soon.
